## How Does It Work?

The Code4z extension pack simplifies your common workflows and enables you to work with COBOL and HLASM code in the same way you work with other languages in Visual Studio Code. The pack provides a modern mainframe programming experience and includes the following features:

- **Language support** for IBM Enterprise COBOL 6.0 and high-level assembler language. 
  - The COBOL Language Support and HLASM Language Support extensions provide syntax highlighting, syntax validation, and content assistance when editing COBOL and HLASM code. Code4z extensions utilize language servers that are fully compatible with the [Language Server Protocol Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification). 
  - You can configure COBOL Language Support to automatically download your copybooks from the mainframe. 
  - The COBOL Control Flow application provides graphical visualization of program flow for COBOL programs.
- **Data editing and file management** of mainframe data sets. 
  - With Zowe Explorer you can allocate, copy, rename, and edit mainframe data sets in VS Code and save them to the mainframe. 
  - The Data Editor for Mainframe extension enables you to edit VSAM data sets, apply record layouts, and filter records using selection criteria.
- **Testing tools** for CICS and Batch programs. 
  - The Debugger for Mainframe extension enables you to debug CICS and Batch applications that are written in COBOL and High-Level Assembler Language. 
  - With Abend Analyzer for Mainframe you can view abend reports and symbolic data. 
  - The HLASM Language Support extension enables you to trace Assembler macros interactively.
- **Source code management** integrated with Endevor. 
  - With the help of the Explorer for Endevor extension you can retrieve, browse, and search Endevor elements in your IDE.
- **Mainframe operations**.
  - With Zowe Explorer you can issue TSO and MVS commands and submit JCL.
  
### Sample Workflows

#### Edit COBOL and HLASM source code stored on the mainframe

* Use Explorer for Endevor to download code elements and their dependencies into the current workspace.
* Edit COBOL code with COBOL Language Support, and take advantage of all the coding assistance that the extension provides.
* Use COBOL Control Flow to easily navigate around different parts of the source code.
* Edit assembler code and trace macros using HLASM Language Support.
* Locate all copybooks in the workspace and, if needed, download other copybooks that are used in the source code from the mainframe.
* Search and browse additional code elements in the entire map of Endevor, using the Explorer for Endevor extension.

#### Run a debug session on a CICS program

* Edit and execute JCL with Zowe Explorer to run unit tests.
* Use Abend Analyzer for Mainframe to view an abend report and diagnose an issue.
* Set up a debug session using Debugger for Mainframe and set breakpoints in the code.
* Trigger the CICS transaction on the mainframe.
* Start a debug session using Debugger for Mainframe.
* Stop at designated breakpoints, displaying and changing any problematic code or variable values.
* Use Data Editor for Mainframe to extend the test data in your VSAM files.
* Run the tests again.
