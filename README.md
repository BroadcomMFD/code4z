### Features

* Debug COBOL code for applications running in a CICS region

## Sample Workflows

### COBOL Language Support using CA Endevor Bridge for Git and Explorer for Endevor
* Use VS Code’s built-in git interface to git clone source code from CA Endevor using Endevor’s Bridge for Git
* Edit COBOL code using the COBOL Language Support, taking advantage of all the coding assistance provided by the extension
* Use VS Code’s built-in git interface to push, pull and merge changes
* Eventually, search and browse additional code elements in the entire map of Endevor using the Explorer for Endevor extension. Editing is not allowed, but the COBOL Language Support will provide syntax awareness for COBOL elements
* Download code elements, including their dependencies, using the Explorer for Endevor extension into the current workspace  to by synchronized witch the Git project if code modifications are needed

### Debugger for Mainframe

* Provide InterTest server location, CICS region, credentials and program/transaction name (either by file or input form)
* Obtain the listing and define breakpoints
* Start a debug session after triggering the CICS transaction
* Display variable values and change variable values
* Stop at designated breakpoints, continue from designated breakpoint and step through the listing
* Close debug session

### Zowe Explorer and Developer Testing

* Unit test code changes by submitting batch jobs. Access JCL in datasets using Zowe Explorer and submit them to the target z/OS system. View the results on the VS Code editor allowing quick and easy batch based unit testing of their code changes
