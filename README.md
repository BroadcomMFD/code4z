# Code4z

Code4z is an all-in-one mainframe extension package for developers working with z/OS applications, suitable for all levels of mainframe experience, even beginners.

Mainframe application developers can use the Code4z package for a modern, familiar, and seamless experience, which helps to overcome some developers' reservations or concerns about the traditional mainframe user experience.

Developers can now find the code they need to work on in Explorer for Endevor and Zowe Explorer, edit using COBOL or HLASM Language Support, and test the resulting code with the Debugger, all in one Mainframe development package.

### Features

* Debug COBOL code for applications running in a CICS region.

## Sample Workflows

### COBOL Language Support using CA Endevor Bridge for Git and Explorer for Endevor
* Use VS Code’s built-in Git interface to clone source code from CA Endevor using Endevor’s Bridge for Git.
* Edit COBOL code using COBOL Language Support, taking advantage of all the coding assistance provided by the extension.
* Use VS Code’s built-in Git interface to push, pull and merge changes.
* Search and browse additional code elements in the entire map of Endevor using the Explorer for Endevor extension. The COBOL Language Support extension provides syntax awareness for COBOL elements.
* Download code elements, including their dependencies, into the current workspace using the Explorer for Endevor extension, and synchronize them with the Git project if code modifications are needed.

### Debugger for Mainframe

* Provide InterTest server location, CICS region, credentials and program/transaction name (either by file or input form).
* Obtain the listing and set breakpoints.
* Trigger the CICS transaction and start a debug session.
* Display and change variable values.
* Stop at designated breakpoints, continue from a designated breakpoint and step through the listing.
* Close the debug session.

### Zowe Explorer and Zowe CLI

* Access mainframe files and execute jobs, either from an interactive graphical interface or in the terminal with CLI. Whether you want to view a PDS, allocate a dataset, change a JCL, submit a mainframe compile, or download and upload files, both interfaces provide these capabilities.
