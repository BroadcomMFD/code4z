## How Does It Work?

Code4z extensions utilize language servers that are fully compatible with the [Language Server Protocol Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification). Additional editor extensions simplify your common workflows and enable you to work with COBOL and HLASM code in the same way you work with other languages in Visual Studio Code.

With the Code4z extension pack you can:
- Utilize syntax highlighting, real time syntax validation and content assist when editing COBOL and HLASM code.
- Automatically retrieve copybooks from the mainframe.
- Trace HLASM macros.
- Retrieve, browse and search CA Endevor® elements.
- Access z/OS Datasets and z/OS Unix file systems, and submit JCLs.
- Debug COBOL code for applications running in a CICS region.
- View and download job output.
- Issue TSO commands.

## Sample Workflows

### COBOL Language Support using CA Endevor Bridge for Git and Explorer for Endevor
* Use VS Code’s built-in Git interface to clone source code from CA Endevor using Endevor’s Bridge for Git.
* Edit COBOL code using COBOL Language Support, taking advantage of all the coding assistance provided by the extension.
* Locate all copybooks in the Git folder structure, and if needed, download other copybooks used in the source code from the mainframe.
* Use VS Code’s built-in Git interface to push, pull and merge changes.
* Search and browse additional code elements in the entire map of Endevor using the Explorer for Endevor extension. The COBOL Language Support extension provides syntax awareness for COBOL elements.
* Download code elements, including their dependencies, into the current workspace using the Explorer for Endevor extension, and synchronize them with the Git project if code modifications are needed.

### Debugger for Mainframe

* Provide InterTest server location, CICS region, credentials and program/transaction name (either by file or input form).
* Obtain the listing and set breakpoints.
* Trigger the CICS transaction and start a debug session.
* Display and change variable values.
* Stop at designated breakpoints, continue from a designated breakpoint and step through the listing.
* Close the debug session.

### Zowe Explorer and Zowe CLI

* Access mainframe files and execute jobs, either from an interactive graphical interface or in the terminal with CLI. Whether you want to view a PDS, allocate a dataset, change a JCL, submit a mainframe compile, or download and upload files, both interfaces provide these capabilities.
